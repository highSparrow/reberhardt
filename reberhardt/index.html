                    <p>
                        I'm a student and software developer from the suburbs of Chicago.
                        I started programming when I was nine years old and was captivated by the possibilities;
                        I've been addicted to building things ever since.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I primarily do full-stack web development, but I also enjoy working with mobile applications, machine learning algorithms, cryptography, and production infrastructure (systems administration and cybersecurity).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to just writing code, I love working with other people and teaching beginners to program.
                        I have taught several programming classes, and continue to mentor students in the <a href="https://www.imsa.edu/">Illinois Math and Science Academy's</a> Advanced Computing Association.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also enjoy all types of digital media production, including <a href="#photography">photography</a>, cinematography, 3D animation, and music production.
                        I founded <a href="http://www.imsastudentproductions.com">IMSA Student Productions</a> at the <a href="https://www.imsa.edu/">Illinois Math and Science Academy</a>.
                        I love making music, and I play violin, viola, guitar, drums, and piano.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I built this website from scratch in my free time with HTML, Sass, and a touch of JavaScript.

                            Tux is an open-source collaborative markup language editor.
                            I originally designed it to render what I'm calling "Markdown+Math" -- a markup language using GFM for formatting and LaTeX for math --
                            but I've designed it with extensibility in mind so it can support other markup languages in the future.
                            It supports live rendering, so you can type markup syntax in the left pane and see a live preview in the right.
                            I'm currently working on adding Google-Docs-style collaboration features.

                            that assists people in selecting proper budget codes for various expenses and in submitting expense requisitions.
                            It was designed to accommodate Harvest's unique budgeting system.
                            The project uses the Python <a href="http://www.pylonsproject.org/">Pyramid</a>

                            Empassage is a distributed, P2P messaging service implementing end-to-end elliptic-curve cryptography.
                            Unlike email, conversations conducted over Empassage cannot be eavesdropped on or compromised by a third party, and the sender of a message cannot be spoofed.
                            Empassage also includes delivery receipt support and a proof-of-work system that largely prevents spam.
                            The application core is written in <a href="http://golang.org">Go</a>, and includes a web interface built with <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>.

                            Under <a href="http://navier.com">Navier, Inc.</a>, I designed a landing page to garner anticipation for the launch of <a href="http://illinois.com">Illinois.com</a>.
                            The site is a simple single-page project, with no backend component.
                            It was more of an exercise in graphic design than programming, in a sense, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.

                        <p>
                            Anvil is a tool enabling web developers to interact directly with customers in the concept and prototyping stages of feature development.
                            (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ6gOkFeRkg">Watch the pitch.</a>)
                            Developers can select any git branch with semi-functional code, and it will be deployed at a separate subdomain in a clone of the production environment;
                            users can then view this prototype, before it's ready for production, and work directly with developers (or customer service) to provide feedback.
                            This beats the alternative of making a release, gathering feedback, realizing customers don't understand how a feature is supposed to work,
                            making another release, collecting feedback again, and so on (a long, iterative cycle).
                            Anvil comprises several discrete components running on different servers, all communicating over REST APIs.
                            The backend components are mostly written in Python and use MySQL, Docker, and Xen.
                            The frontend is built using <a href="https://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>.
                            Unfortunately, Anvil was not earning enough revenue, and is no longer actively developed or running in production.

                            I founded IMSA Student Productions (ISP) at my high school, the Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy, as a student-led, professionally-advised extracurricular for those interested in media production.
                            (<a href="https://imsastudentproductions.com/about">Read more here.</a>)
                            After building a team, I built this website to manage team operations and publish the media we produced.
                            Students and staff submit requests for ISP coverage, and ISP members can volunteer for the events they would like to cover.
                            After covering events, members upload their media and post a reflection on their experience; IMSA staff then approve or reject the media for publication.
                            The site also integrates with the school's LDAP directory for easy student authentication and has an SMTP component for sending notifications.
                            The backend is built using the Python <a href="http://www.pylonsproject.org/">Pyramid</a> framework and a MySQL database;

                            The backends are built with <a href="http://www.pylonsproject.org/">Pyramid</a> and MySQL, and use <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase's</a> Merchant API.

                            (several of which had difficult-to-use interfaces, if any GUI at all) in a single user-friendly application.
                            The application was written in Java with Swing.
                            Unfortunately, due to time constraints, the project did not mature past a beta release.

                        The Advanced Computing Association (ACA) is an extracurricular at the <a href="https://www.imsa.edu">Illinois Math and Science Academy</a>
                        that provides education in advanced areas of technology and supplies students with equipment and infrastructure to pursue independent ventures.
                        Regular workshops cover topics including programming languages, networking, and server administration, and "hack nights" provide students
                        with the opportunity to work on developing their own projects with experienced members available to assist.
                        A 5-server production rack hosts student projects and supporting services;
                        a 3-server development rack hosts experimental services and allows students to experience a complete rebuild and reconfiguration (from scratch) of a "production" network.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I served as ACA's president from 2012-2014, building most of its production infrastructure from scratch and spearheading student workshops, and I continue to teach and mentor.
                        I love engaging with current students and seeing their ideas come to life.
                        While it's become harder to visit the IMSA campus, I help students with code reviews on ACA's <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">Gitlab</a> instance,
                        participate in brainstorming sessions and answer questions on ACA's <a href="http://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a> forum,
                        and occasionally stop by for a hack night or workshop.

                    <p>
                        The <a href="https://www.imsa.edu">Illinois Math and Science Academy</a> provides students with a top-notch education, particularly in the areas of math and science, and I learned a great amount while there.
                        One summer break, I asked a classmate who lives in my area if he would be interested in teaching classes covering some of these advanced, interesting topics to local junior high and high school students,
                        sharing the opportunity to learn material that students might otherwise never be exposed to.
                        He agreed, and thus was born Foundations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Foundations offers free summer classes for local students covering various STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) topics,
                        including cellular biology, immunology, advanced chemistry, calculus, and Java programming.
                        We sought to select course material that is often not covered in standard high school curriculums, yet is accessible to motivated junior high and high school students.
                        We also attempted to not merely teach material, but to also ignite a sense of awe and curiosity in students, such that they might pursue more advanced material independently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Courses began with my brothers' friends, but expanded through word of mouth, and soon classes filled with new faces.
                        Watching seventh-grade students come to understand how exactly a human body works when it "gets the flu" and how water enables life-giving chemical reactions was a wonderful experience,
                        and one that I hope to have again in the near future.

                    <h2>Intersession Courses at the Illinois Math and Science Academy</h2>
                    <p>
                        Each year, the Illinois Math and Science Academy (IMSA) offers week-long <a href="https://www.imsa.edu/academics/Intersession%202015">intersession classes</a> between the first and second semesters.
                        These courses enable students to get a taste of new subject areas without taking full-length classes or learn about niche topics that no courses are offered in.

                    <h3>Behind the Music Video (2014)</h3>
                    <p>
                        From the course description:
                        <span class="quote">
                            Music is one of the most powerful creative means of expression, and holds the power to cheer, inspire,
                            and unite masses of people. Music videos extend this capacity, adding another dimension of creativity.
                            This intersession course covers recording and mastering techniques, storyboarding, editing and
                            production, camera fundamentals, live direction, and more. By the end of the course, students will record
                            and produce their own music video to showcase to friends and family.
                        </span>
                        In the course, a friend and I taught the fundamentals of music video production;
                        students then independently conceived and produced videos in groups.

                    <h3>Android Programming with Java (2013)</h3>
                    <p>
                        From the course description:
                        <span class="quote">
                            This intersession will introduce students to creating Android applications with Java. Students will use
                            Eclipse to develop basic applications utilizing buttons, scroll lists, dialog boxes, and event handlers.
                            Advanced students will have the opportunity to develop more complex applications, such as a media
                            player, custom web browser, or simple game.
                        </span>
                        This course was especially challenging for me to teach, as I was the only instructor and had no prior formal teaching experience.
                        In addition, the skill levels of the students varied wildly, with some having years of programming experience and others hardly knowing what Java is.
                        Despite that, I learned as I taught, and at the end of the class,
                        the students successfully built an app that sets off an alarm if you haven't touched the phone in the last 20 minutes,
                        preventing you from falling asleep while studying on the late nights :)
